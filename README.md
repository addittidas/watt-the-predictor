# Watt-the-Predictor : Energy Consumption Prediction

This project predicts building energy consumption using the ASHRAE dataset. It explores multiple ML models and deploys the best ones using an interactive Streamlit web app.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to build predictive models for energy usage (electricity, chilled water, steam, hot water) based on:
- 🏢 Building metadata
- 🌦️ Weather conditions
- 🕒 Timestamp features (day, hour, etc.)

The app lets you:
- Select different trained models
- View model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, RMSLE, R²)
- See feature importances (for tree-based models)
- Input values manually or upload a CSV
- Get predictions + download results
